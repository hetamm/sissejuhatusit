<p> The stressful life of a university student can be made brighter by increasing their daily coffee intake and ensuring a great laughter. 
The aim of this page is to produce some funny content and also to <strong>ensure great points at Sissejuhatus IT-sse subject exam.</strong> </p>

<p> In order to show some support, you can make a donation to TTU bank account in order to help poor university student buy some milk for their coffee. </p>
